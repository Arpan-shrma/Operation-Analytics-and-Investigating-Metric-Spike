# Project Description:-
Operation Analytics is the analysis done for the complete end to end operations of a company and investigating metric spikes is part of operation analytics. In this project, I have used the Operation_Analytics_and_Investigating_Metric_Spike database provided by trainity and drawn some conclusions in the form of case study 1 and 2. I have provided insights to topics serving different departments of the company. I have used Structured Query Language for data analytics.
# Approach:-
Firstly, I have used SQL queries to process raw data and create a relational database with various tables on mysql workbench. Then, I have used different queries to draw insights and answer all the possible questions. Finally, I combined all the results into this report.
# Tech-Stack Used:-
I have used “MySQL Server 8.0.32” for locally hosting the database and “MySQL Workbench 8.0.24” as an interface for SQL query editor. It was easy to work with databases and better visualization.
